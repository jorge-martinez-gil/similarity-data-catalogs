   - Introduces the concept of catalog similarity.
2. **Related Works**
   - Reviews literature on ODC similarity and standard data catalog vocabularies.
3. **Similarity Methods for Open Data Catalogs**
   - **3.1**: Repositories of Triples
   - **3.2**: Repositories of Tokens
   - **3.3**: Character Sequences
4. **Conclusion**
   - Summarizes findings and suggests future research directions.
